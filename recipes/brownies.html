    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Ages of searching for a proper brownie recipe have lead me here. A from scratch recipe that holds up to the
        prepared box brownies you can buy in the store.</p>
    <p> </p>
    <p>Below, I will provide you with all the ingredients and instructions needed to make your own delicious brownies to
        enjoy!</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <Li>1 1/2 cups granulated sugar</Li>
        <Li>3/4 cup all-purpose flour</Li>
        <Li>2/3 cup cocoa powder, sifted if lumpy</Li>
        <Li>1/2 cup powdered sugar, sifted if lumpy</Li>
        <Li>1/2 cup dark chocolate chips</Li>
        <Li>3/4 teaspoons sea salt</Li>
        <Li>2 large eggs</Li>
        <Li>1/2 cup canola oil or extra-virgin olive oil</Li>
        <Li>2 tablespoons water</Li>
        <Li>1/2 teaspoon vanilla</Li>
    </ul>
    <H3>Steps</H3>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 325Â°F. Lightly spray an 8x8 baking dish (not a 9x9 dish or your brownies will overcook)
            with cooking spray and line it with parchment paper. Spray the parchment paper.</li>
        <li>In a medium bowl, combine the sugar, flour, cocoa powder, powdered sugar, chocolate chips, and salt.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, olive oil, water, and vanilla.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle the dry mix over the wet mix and stir until just combined.</li>
        <li>Pour the batter into the prepared pan (it'll be thick - that's ok) and use a spatula to smooth the top. Bake
            for 40 to 48 minutes, or until a toothpick comes out with only a few crumbs attached (note: it's better to
            pull the brownies out early than to leave them in too long). Cool completely before slicing. Store in an
            airtight container at room temperature for up to 3 days. These also freeze well!</li>

    </ol>
